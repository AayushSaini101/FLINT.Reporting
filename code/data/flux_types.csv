"Wildfire","Fluxes that are the result of a wildfire disturbance event. This can include emissions to the atmosphere as well as transfers between pools and can include carbon and other non-carbon greenhouse gases",1
"Controlled Burning","Fluxes that are the result of a controlled burning disturbance. This can include emissions to the atmosphere as well as transfers between pools",1
"Net primary production","The mass of photosynthate remaining after taking into account loss due to autotrophic respiration",1
"Harvest","Fluxes that are the result of a harvest event where all trees are harvested which can be fluxes between onsite pools or can be fluxes to offsite pools",1
"Decomposition","Fluxes due to the decay of organic matter in dead organic matter and soil",1
"Turnover","Fluxes due to normal processes of leaf, bark, and branch shedding and movement through debris and soil carbon pools due to decay",1
"Plough","Fluxes from a tillage disturbance on crop and grass",1
"Thin","Fluxes that are the result of a thin event where not all trees are harvested or felled which can be fluxes between onsite pools or can be fluxes to offsite pools",1
"Plant Trees","When tree seedlings are planted there is a small carbon flux from offsite to tree pools",1
"Plant Crops","When crops are sown or planted there is a carbon flux from offsite to crop pools",1
"Nitrogen Fertiliser","A flux that is the result of nitrogen fertiliser application",1
"Pest","Fluxes due to pest attack, for example transfer of leaves to the fine litter pools",1
"Windthrow","Fluxes due to tree death due to being blown over by wind",1
"Lime Application","Carbon fluxes associated with lime and dolomite application",1
"Grazing","Fluxes between plant pools due to animal grazing",1
"Irrigation","H20 fluxes due to irrigation",1
"Herbicide","Fluxes due to plant death from herbicide application",1
"Manure","Fluxes from the application of manure from offsite",1
"Heavy roll","Flux of carbon due to chopper rolling",1
"Wetland Drainage","Flux of N due to wetland drainage and rewetting",1
"Rice","Special case where CH4 is transmitted through the stem",1
"Cattle Grazing","Carbon fluxes due to cattle grazing",1
"Sheep Grazing","Carbon fluxes due to sheep grazing",1
"Goat Grazing","Carbon fluxes due to goat grazing",1
