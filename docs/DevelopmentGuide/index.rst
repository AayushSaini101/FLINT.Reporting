Development Guide
=================

This documentation is an entry level guide into the architectural
disposition of the Reporting Tool. Its role is to show the building
blocks of the Reporting Tool and the rationale behind it. More technical
explanations of the source code should be found within each Reporting
Tool’s repository on GitHub.

This documentation is strongly related to a series of guides detailing
how to set up and operate the Reporting Tool. We recommend that you have
a look at them as well for a more fuller understanding of the domain.

Prerequisites
-------------

We need to meet two main preconditions in order to successfully
contribute Reporting Tool’s development:

== =====================================================
\  Prerequirement
== =====================================================
1  We need to have sufficient Java development skills
2  We need to have sufficient Angular development skills
== =====================================================

Outline
-------

There are six things that we need to understand to contribute to the
Reporting Tool’s development:

== ==============================================================
\  Prerequirement
== ==============================================================
1  The major design elements that make up the Moja Reporting Tool
2  The functional decomposition of the above elements
3  The execution elements of the functionally decomposed elements
4  The tool’s source code organization
5  The long term vision and direction for continuous improvement
6  The logical next areas for improvement
== ==============================================================

We will explore each of the above concepts in detail in the specific
parts of the documentation.
